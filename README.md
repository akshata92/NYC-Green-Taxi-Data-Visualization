# The Green Taxi - Not So Green Anymore?
A Tableau based visual storytelling by Akshata Salehittal and Gaurav Shahane of University of Maryland College Park

New York loves its taxicabs.

There are over 20,000 Yellow and Green taxicabs in New York. The additional e-hail services such as Uber and Lyft are bringing a lot more number of taxis in the New York region. Prior to 2013, most of the outer boroughs of New York were underserved by yellow cabs and were dominated by unlicensed drivers. 

Introduced in 2013, Green taxis were meant to serve the outer boroughs(Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island and Manhattan above the 110th Street) to tackle the illegal taxi problem. Almost 3 years since its launch, as per various news articles, Green taxi is not doing that well. It would be interesting to know how the Greens are performing based on Taxi Trip Records in New York.

Let’s take a dive into their performance:

The road for Green taxis had been difficult for many reasons, primarily being the no hail southern manhattan zone. With the introduction of ‘Go Arro’ and ‘Way2ride’ apps around Aug 2015, things changed. The ridership of Green Taxi increased in the latter half of 2015, but after the initial boost however, the number of trips have been decreasing steadily for last few months starting March 2016.
